I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) ([LTCI](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/research/labs/information-processing-ltci), [COMELEC](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/school/departments/communications-electronics)), focusing on [generative models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) applied to [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). I am supervised by [Jhony Giraldo](https://sites.google.com/view/jhonygiraldo), [Enzo Tartaglione](https://enzotarta.github.io/) and [Lirida Naviner de Barros](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/lirida-naviner). The PhD is done in collaboration with [Arteris](https://www.arteris.com/) and aims at developing a deep-learning model able to generate electronic chip designs.

Previously, I interned at the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/), working on the [Maximum Clique Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem), a [combinatorial problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization). I was supervised by [Francesco Rinaldi](https://sites.google.com/view/francescorinaldi/home-page?authuser=1) and [Damiano Zeffiro](https://damianozeffiro.github.io/).

I hold engineering degrees from [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), [Eurecom](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/node/388) and [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://www.master-mva.com/). My research interests aim at generalizing the work done for [image](https://www.midjourney.com/home) / [video](https://openai.com/index/sora/) / [music](https://suno.com/) generation to a more abstract layer, in order to make these techniques work for a much broader field of application.
